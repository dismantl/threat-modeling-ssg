# Rage Against Threat Modeling

_"Some of those that work forces,</br>
are the same that burn ~crosses~ 0-days"_

`ratm` is a tool that helps you think about your threat model, generating a static site and graphs that help you navigate them.

It takes its inspiration on [PyTM](https://github.com/OWASP/pytm), but simplifying how things work, by removing dependencies to Java utilities.

This tool actually came out as a way to do the threat modeling of [dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks).

## Run the demo

We include a short demo showcasing how to define components, threats, boundaries and scenarios. Here is how to generate a static site out of it:

```bash
uv run demo/model.py | uvx ratm
```

## Model format

A model is a Python script that uses the `Ratm` builders. `demo/model.py` is a
commented example. The script prints a report, and `ratm` turns that report
into the site.

**Properties** describe components (`tm.define_properties(...)`). A threat's
`requirements` are expressions over them: `prop`, `!prop`, `prop.item`,
`a == b`, `a != b`.

**Threats** (`tm.Threat(id, requirements=[...], ...)`):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mitigations` | ids of the mitigations in place |
| `further_mitigations` | ids of mitigations being considered |
| `status` | `unmanaged`, `accepted`, `transferred`, `mitigated`, `avoided`, `inform`, `partially mitigated` or `out of scope`. The default is `unmanaged`. |
| `impact` | `Low` (1), `Medium` (2) or `High` (3) |
| `likelihood` | `Very Low` (1), `Low` (2), `Medium` (3) or `High` (4) |
| `residual_impact`, `residual_likelihood` | the values with the mitigations in place. They default to `impact` and `likelihood`. |
| `residual_risk` | a note on the risk that remains |
| `threat_actors` | names of threat actors registered with `tm.ThreatActor` |
| `children` | ids of smaller threats that make up this one |
| `capec_info`, `comment` | description and details. If `impact` or `likelihood` is not given, the CAPEC severity and likelihood are used instead. CAPEC's five severity levels are mapped onto the three impact levels. |

Risk is impact times likelihood. The status says how the team is handling the
threat. Mitigations never remove a threat from the report: it is listed for
every component that matches its requirements.

**Mitigations** (`tm.Mitigation(id, title=..., ...)`) have a `description`, a
`status` (`implemented`, `optional` or `proposed`), a `test` naming the
automated test that checks the mitigation, and an optional `property`
expression. The report always shows a mitigation's status. When `property` is
set, the report also checks each affected component for that property and
marks the mitigation as in place or missing there.

**Threat actors** (`tm.ThreatActor(name, description=...)`) must be registered
before a threat can name them.

Generating the report fails with an error naming the problem when:

- a threat names an unknown mitigation, threat actor or child threat, or lists
  itself as a child
- a status is not one of the values above
- an impact or likelihood is given but is not on its scale
- a mitigation's `property` uses a property the model does not define. This
  check only runs when the model defines at least one property.
- two threats, mitigations or threat actors share an id or name
