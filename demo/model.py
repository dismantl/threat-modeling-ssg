# [ Demo threat model ]
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Exemple usage of ratm, describing its very own threat model.
# This is a simplistic example to showcase how the tool works
# and what can be accomplished with it.
#
# RATM is a tool that:
#
# - Let developers use python to define their threat model
# - Compiles the threat model and publishes it on a static site generator
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# create a threat model object that will be used afterwards

# -- Mitigations
#
# Each mitigation is its own object with an id, a title and a status:
# "implemented", "optional" or "proposed". The report shows every
# mitigation's status. Two fields are optional:
#
# - `test` names the automated test that checks the mitigation.
# - `property` names a component property. When it is set, the report also
#   checks each affected component for that property.

# -- Threats
#
# You can define your own threats, naming them and providing:
#
# - a list of requirements, that need to be true for this threat to apply
# - a list of mitigation ids that are in place, and optionally
#   `further_mitigations` that are being considered
# - a `status`: unmanaged, accepted, transferred, mitigated, avoided, inform,
#   partially mitigated or out of scope. The status says how the threat is
#   handled. Mitigations never remove a threat from the report: it is listed
#   for every component that matches its requirements.
# - `impact` (Low, Medium or High) and `likelihood` (Very Low, Low, Medium or
#   High). Risk is impact times likelihood. `residual_impact` and
#   `residual_likelihood` give the values with the mitigations in place, and
#   `residual_risk` explains what is left.
# - `threat_actors`, and `children` listing smaller threats that make up this one.
#
# Threats which are not CAPEC ones can carry their own description and details
# for the report to display. When `impact` or `likelihood` is not given, the
# CAPEC severity and likelihood are used instead.

# In this example, we use sub-resources, using the dot separator.
